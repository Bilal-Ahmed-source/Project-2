# Project-2
EDA of Food Service


The goal of this project is to explore a food service dataset to understand how to improve efficiency and reduce food waste. The data includes things like the number of meals served, kitchen staff, temperature, humidity, and the amount of food wasted. 
My project focuses on studying the dataset and explore different relationships while also making some new features using the given dataset. It is important to analyze this dataset so better strategies regarding staffing optimization, environmental factors and event management can be explored.
